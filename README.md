# HEART DISEASE PREDICTION 
This repository contains heart disease project completed by me for academics , self learning and recreational purposes.Presented in a jupyter notebook and markdown.

**NOTE** data used is for demonstration only

# Overview
Overview
Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect the heart. Heart diseases include:

* Blood vessel disease, such as coronary artery disease
* Irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias)
* Heart problems you're born with (congenital heart defects)
* Disease of the heart muscle
* Heart valve disease
* Many forms of heart disease can be prevented or treated with healthy lifestyle choices.

# Content
* Contains the dataset used in the notebook 
* few exploratory data analysis
* A model to predict if a patient has heart disease or not,using KNeighborsClassifier , RandomForestClassifier and LogisticRegression models
* Hyperparameter tuning using randomizedsearchcv and gridsearchcv
* Model evaluation
